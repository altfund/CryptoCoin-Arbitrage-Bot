open a thread for each active trading market  
get the lowest selling (can buy for) price and highest buying (getting bought for) price for each thread. Compare between threads.  
If someone is selling for less than someone else is buying, or someone is buying for more than someone else is selling (same thing)  
then for the thread with the lowest selling price we buy and we sell at the thread with the highest buying price.  

btc-e (have account and api. Can api sell and buy?)  
bitstamp (need to verify to use api, or can use selenium (not selenium, different library))
