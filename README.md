read the prices for each active trading market  
get the lowest selling (can buy for) price and highest buying (getting bought for) price for each thread. Compare between markets.  
If someone is selling for less than someone else is buying, or someone is buying for more than someone else is selling (same thing)  
then for the market with the lowest selling price we buy and we sell at the market with the highest buying price.  

btc-e (have account and api. Can api sell and buy?)  
bitstamp (need to verify to use api, or can use selenium (not selenium, different library))  


Make sure profit difference is enough to offset transaction fee


buy from place1 with the lower cost to buy. If i can buy for a $/bitcoin less that the minimum $/bitcoin being sold at place2, sell the amount i bought at place1 a price undercutting the minimum $/bitcion sell price at place2.

ex: i buy from place 1 at their minimum buying price, 200$/coin. If everyone at place2 is buying for at most 220$/coin, sell the coins i just bought from place1 at place2 for 219$/coin.

Buy at less $/coin than max place 2 is buying,And the amount I would buy at place 1 is less than the max amount place 2 is buying.
Make sure I'm buying less coin than I have money to buy and can sell in place 2
